# Facial Recognition App

This is a facial recognition application implemented in Python using the OpenCV library. The application can detect faces in real-time camera feeds and compare them with reference images to determine if a match is found.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using Haar Cascade classifier.
- Match detected faces with reference images.
- Capture and save new reference images for recognition.
- Simple command-line interface.

## Requirements

- Python (3.6+ recommended)
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/facial-recognition.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd facial_recognition
3. Install the required python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage 
1. run the facial recognition application
   ```bash
   python main.py
2. Use the following keys to interact with the application:

s: Capture and save a new reference image.
q: Quit the application.
